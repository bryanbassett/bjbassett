## Phase 1: A resume CMS  [done]

Creates frist - a responsive resume website, that when pressing "print" turns the website into a PDF automatically. Your resume will always be up to date, and easy to update. The back end includes the ability to generate shortlinks to be used on your resume/portfolio, letting you know when users clicked through links on your resume.


## Phase 2: A back end invoicing home base

Invoice systems today are expensive, and using spreadsheets gets old and hard to organize while being dynamic. Pulling all the data together is a very manual process. But with this I will be able to do it all in one place, email clients automatically, etc.
